# The Encore developer's best friend

I started this project because I found myself spending hours upon hours writing code to set up the same CRUD endpoints over and over again. With Encore, the deployment part of this is already a breeze - but being lazy, I want to get to the fun part even faster. Therefore, I wrote a script to parse my migrations file to set up the folder structure with the endpoints in my own preferred way.
